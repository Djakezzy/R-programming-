This repository contains 3 files that are all parts of the whole project. I recommend going through to powerpoint presentation first.
This will help understand the main purpose of this project and the steps that were taken in order partition, manipulate and evaluate the data
in order to come up with the final model.
I hope you enjoy exploring me and my teams work.
